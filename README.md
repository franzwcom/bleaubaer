BleauBaer - WordPress starter boiler plate
==========================================

Current Version : 1.1
                  
This is a WordPress theme starter, it's a small simple framework to help the development of a WordPress theme.  
The WordPress theme starter takes advantage of bootstrap on its latest version.  
It also includes bower and sass for styling.
The idea behind of this ( besides the learning purposes) is to get faster the process of designing and coding a WordPress theme by reducing the amount of  time.
